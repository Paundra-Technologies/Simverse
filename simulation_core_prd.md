## Project Title:
**Universal Modular Simulation Core Engine**

## Purpose:
To build a lightweight, extensible, domain-agnostic simulation engine capable of simulating mechanical, electrical, digital, and quantum systems. It will serve as the core framework to support robotics, UAVs, spacecraft, autonomous vehicles, and more.

## Target Users:
- Robotics developers and researchers
- Aerospace engineers
- AI/ML practitioners
- Embedded systems engineers
- Simulation-based education platforms

## Goals:
- Create a highly modular, plugin-based simulation engine.
- Enable multi-domain simulation: mechanical, electrical, digital, quantum.
- Keep the core engine lightweight and scalable.
- Support real-time and headless (batch) simulation modes.
- Build an API and UI layer for visualization and interaction.

## Advanced / Future Features:
- ROS 2 and MQTT bridges
- Multi-agent and swarm simulation
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) interfaces
- WebAssembly/WebGPU deployment
- Visual scenario designer (Tauri or web-based)
- AI/LLM integration for reasoning agents

---

## Why This Architecture Scales Universally:
- Domain-agnostic: supports robots, drones, spacecraft, circuits, quantum systems.
- Plugin-based: new components (sensors, physics) can be added without core changes.
- Multi-resolution: suitable for micro-to-macro simulation.
- Lightweight and embeddable for edge or research-grade HPC use.
- Suited for both real-time control and batch/CI simulations.

## What You Can Simulate with This:
- Robot Arm: joints, kinematics, torque, sensors.
- Drone: propeller physics, IMU, GPS, flight control.
- Autonomous Car: LiDAR, SLAM, path planning.
- Spacecraft: orbital mechanics, thrust, solar power.
- Missile: trajectory, seeker, navigation.
- Quantum Circuit: qubit states, entanglement, gate ops.

## The Secret to Universality:
> **Modularity + Messaging + Plug-in Physics = Universal Simulator Core**

Youâ€™re not hardcoding robot logic or sensor types. Instead, your architecture allows components to be:
- **Loaded dynamically** based on simulation needs.
- **Simulated independently** with encapsulated logic.
- **Composed into any system**, from a simple rover to a quantum-powered drone.
- **Swapped or extended** with plugins, even at runtime.
- **Tested and reused** across domains (e.g., same PID controller for robot and drone).
- **Interconnected** through a clean event-driven interface.

This makes it possible to simulate everything from educational toy bots to full-blown autonomous interplanetary systems.

## Performance Benchmarks:
- Simulation tick rate: Target 1000+ steps/second in headless mode for small scenarios.
- Real-time stability: Less than 5ms jitter under normal load (CPU-bound conditions).
- Memory usage: Core engine under 10MB RSS without plugins.
- Plugin overhead: Each loaded plugin module should consume <2MB and initialize under 50ms.
- Logging throughput: Support up to 1,000,000 structured logs/sec with async write.
- Multi-entity scalability: Support up to 10,000 entities with moderate physics in a batch simulation.
- Cold-start time: Under 1s for CLI or headless mode, under 3s with UI.

---

## Success Criteria:
- Simulates at least 5 system types (robot, drone, vehicle, satellite, circuit)
- Plugin integration without modifying the core
- Demonstrable simulation with real-time and headless mode
- Simple extensibility (e.g., add a new sensor in <30 min)
- Community or early-adopter feedback

---

## Tech Stack:
- Language: Rust
- Visualization: Bevy or Egui
- Physics: Rapier or custom plugin
- Data: Serde (JSON/RON), SQLite for logs
- Plugin: Trait-based dynamic dispatch or macro plugin loader
